com­ply­ing with some formal rules. What would you do with the results
if you don&#8217;t know those rules?</em></p>

<p>This document comments on &#8220;HTML validation&#8221;
as performed by software such as the online services
<a href="http://validator.w3.org">W3C Validator</a>
and
<a href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/validator/">WDG Validator</a>, and
<a href="http://www.arealvalidator.com/">A Real Validator</a>,
a product for offline use on Windows.
&#8220;CSS validation&#8221; will be briefly discussed too.</p>

<h2 id="formal">Validation is formal</h2>

<p>To be exact, there is no such thing as 
&#8220;HTML validation&#8221;. The concept of validation that matters
here is SGML or XML validation.
SGML is a meta-notation used to define
the formal &#8220;syntax&#8221; rules of various markup notations, or
markup &#8220;languages&#8221;, to use the common misnomer. All
that an SGML validator does is that it reads a formalized syntax
definition (called DTD, Document Type Definition) and a document that
purports to comply with that definition, then reports
any mismatches.</p>

<p>Consider the following <strong>example</strong> of a DTD:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><code>&lt;!ELEMENT list   - - (item)+&gt;</code></div>
<div><code>&lt;!ELEMENT item   - - (person, phone)&gt;</code></div>
<div><code>&lt;!ELEMENT person - - CDATA&gt;</code></div>
<div><code>&lt;!ELEMENT phone  - - CDATA&gt;</code></div>
</blockquote>
<p>It defines a the formal structure of a very simple
telephone catalog, consisting of items which contain a name
and a number. The internal structure of the names and numbers
is not defined here; from the viewpoint of this DTD, they are
just character data (CDATA). But the DTD defines that a document
(here, a phone catalog) consists of an element called
<code>list</code>, which consists of the tags
<code>&lt;list&gt</code>
and
<code>&lt;/list&gt</code> and a sequence of <code>item</code>
elements between them. These elements in turn have a defined structure,
and so on. All the end tags are defined as obligatory.
Now, suppose we feed the following data to an SGML validator:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE list [</code></div>
<div class="indent"><code>&lt;!ELEMENT list   - - (item)+></code></div>
<div class="indent"><code>&lt;!ELEMENT item   - - (person, phone)></code></div>
<div class="indent"><code>&lt;!ELEMENT person - - CDATA></code></div>
<div class="indent"><code>&lt;!ELEMENT phone  - - CDATA> ]></code></div>
<div><code>&lt;list></code></div>
<div><code>&lt;item>&lt;person>Liisa&lt;/person>&lt;phone>313&lt;/phone>&lt;/item></code></div>
<div><code>&lt;item>&lt;person>Jukka&lt;/person>&lt;phone>333&lt;/phone></code></div>
<div><code>&lt;/list></code></div>
</blockquote>

<p>You would then get <em>something like</em> the following
(the format of reporting the error will vary):</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Line 9, character 7:
<pre><code class=html>&lt;/list&gt;</code>
      <strong>^</strong></pre>
<p>Error: end tag for  <strong class=html>ITEM</strong> omitted; possible causes include a missing end tag,  <a href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/validator/problems.html#nesting">improper nesting</a> of elements, or use of an element where it is not allowed</p></li>
<li>Line 8, character 1:
<pre><code class=html>&lt;item&gt;&lt;person&gt;Jukka&lt;/person&gt;&lt;phone&gt;333&lt;/phone&gt;</code>
<strong>^</strong></pre>
<p> start tag was here</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote> 

<p>What the error message says is simply that the document does
not comply with the formal rules that it claims to conform to,
in the particular detail that the end tag <code>&lt;/item&gt;</code>
has been omitted but the DTD does not allow such omission.
The validator gives this message relating to the
<code>&lt;/list&gt;</code> tag, which is potentially misleading,
since there is nothing wrong with <em>that</em> tag. The validator
just expected (on the basis of the DTD) another tag before it.</p>
<p>The message also refers to the <em>possibility</em> that the
problem was caused by improper nesting. As so often when programs
try to be helpful, this is a wrong hint here.</p> 

<p>Note that there is absolutely no HTML in the preceding example.
Validation is <em>not</em> an HTML matter, except  in the simple sense
that HTML syntax can be defined in SGML, implying that an
HTML document together with a DTD can be validated.</p>

<p><small>To confuse things a bit, some validators actually
think they are always processing HTML documents. This mainly means
that the wordings of their error messages might reflect this and
could mislead you if you used them for other purposes.</small></p>

<p><small>To confuse things more, some validators issue various
<em>warnings</em> based on more or less heuristic checks, not DTDs.
Useful as such warnings can be, they tend to cause problems in
understanding the differences and impacts of validation errors and
other messages.</small></p>


<h2 id="doctype">The DOCTYPE confusion</h2>
<p>In the example above, the DTD was part of the document
being validated. This is usually not practical, so normally the
document contains just a <em>reference</em> to a DTD, in the form of
a so-called DOCTYPE declaration.</p>
<p>For each official version of HTML, including e.g. the three
different 
<a href=
"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/global.html#h-7.2"
>sub-versions of HTML 4.01</a>,
you will find a corresponding
DOCTYPE declaration that you can use. You can just put it into
one or two lines at the start of your document, and use a validator
to find all the violations of the DTD that there might be in
your document.</p>
<p>This would be fine, but great confusion has been caused by
&#8220;DOCTYPE sniffing&#8221;: browsers have started drawing
conclusions from the presence or absence of DOCTYPE declarations,
even paying great attention to their spelling. This is really bad,
though it does not directly affect validation.
But for an explanation of the
confusion as well as some practical con­clu­sions,

<h2 id="gain">So what do I get from validation?</h2>

<p>It is generally useful to write HTML in a manner that
complies with published HTML 
spec­i­fi­ca­tions.
This gives you
much better <em>chances</em> of being cross-browser compatible
and making your pages work on future browsers, too. Browsers don&#8217;t
always implement all that HTML specifications say, but anything
<em>beyond</em> the specifications tends to be either very
browser-specific or at least inconsistently handled by browsers.
And <em>part</em> of complying with a 
spec­i­fi­ca­tion is
complying with the syntax defined by it, the DTD.</p>

<div>Validation helps</div>
<ul>
<li>to avoid typos
<li>to detect that you have misunderstood some syntax rules.
</ul>

<p class="important">Validation is about catching some syntax errors,
nothing more. It is useful only if you know the syntax rules
so that you can see what&#8217;s wrong. Validation does not do any­thing
that you would not be able to do on your own.
Validation is useful
because you, being presumably
human, are not particularly good at following formal rules
or checking that they are obeyed.</p>

<p>Thus, a validator does <em>not</em> teach you how to write HTML.
It just points out mistakes. You are supposed to learn HTML from
other sources.</p>

<p>Validation 
tells that the syntax rules are violated. This is mostly just confusing if 
you don&#8217;t know what those rules 
<em>are</em>. Thus, to make use of validation, you need
to learn the syntax of HTML, in the particular variant you use.</p>
<p>Validation is
like taking a paper to a secretary and asking him to check in each and 
every detail that all the formal rules of the Company Regulations are 
strictly obeyed, marking all violations, and nothing more.
Would you complain when he does exactly that? Yet many people use
a  validator (since they have been told to), then start accusing the
validator for nitpicking or using wrong rules or whatever.</p>

<p class="important">If you really want to understand the formal syntax
of HTML and to know how to read validator reports, you need to learn
SGML or XML <em>and</em> to read the applicable DTDs. But there is
a shortcut that lets you get most of the benefits of validation without
too much work: Use the excellent 
<cite><a href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/">HTML&nbsp;4.0
Reference</a></cite>  
by the Web Design Group.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not the ultimate, authoritative reference, and
4.0 slightly differs from 4.01, but for the most of it, this
reference tells you rather understandably what the syntax is.
The alphabetic list of elements contains links to element descriptions
with attribute descriptions as well as sections
&#8220;Contents&#8221; and
&#8220;Contained in&#8221;, where you can find readable explanations
of the relevant nesting rules.</p>

<h2 id="good">Valid documents can be wrong</h2>

<p>Validation doesn&#8217;t mean that your pages are good in any
other sense but the technical sense of not containing violations of
the DTD. It is quite possible to have a document that passes validation
but is still in definitive violation of HTML specifications. The DTD
covers just some aspects, some of the formal aspects. For example,
an <code>href</code> attribute value is basically just a string,
as far as the DTD is concerned. Any nonsense like
<code>href="anything&nbsp;I&nbsp;put&nbsp;here!!¤¤#?"</code> will
pass and <em>must</em> pass validation, since the DTD is not violated.</p>

<p>Although there is really not much to be gained from using 
<strong>XHTML</strong> on web pages,
many people have started using it. 
Moreover, XHTML has its uses, in conjunction with software that
can operate on XHTML but not HTML.
Then it becomes relevant
that validation means different things for XHTML. The reason is that
the metalanguage, XML, is considerably less powerful than SGML.
For example, the XML DTD for XHTML&nbsp;1.0 declares the
<code>tabindex</code> attribute as CDATA,
which allows virtually anything. In the SGML DTDs of
&#8220;old&#8221; HTML,
the attribute is declared as NUMBER. This means that in
validating against &#8220;old&#8221; HTML, <code>tabindex="-1"</code>
is reported as an error (as it is), in XHTML validation it passes.
On the other hand, XML imposes restrictions that forbid
constructs that are formally correct in SGML-based HTML but
not actually supported by browsers, such as the shorthand
<code>&lt;em/text/</code> for
<code>&lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt;</code>, and this means
that XHTML validation is pragmatically more useful 
in <em>some</em> ways.</p>

<p>Thus, a valid HTML document can be incorrect even in a very technical
sense of violating the specifications. Naturally it may also trigger
browser bugs, lack any useful content, contain absurd (though valid)
markup, and so on. And it will be rendered differently by different 
browsers, of course; that&#8217;s how things are meant to work.</p>

<p>Besides, there can be reasons to deviate from published DTDs.
Some people think they need to use <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code>
markup; I think
<code>&lt;nobr&gt;</code> is sometimes useful; and so on.
If you decide to use markup that does not belong to the DTD of any
published HTML version, you can still make your documents 
valid in all other aspects. You could even write a DTD of your own
(mod­i­fied from a public one), though this will require some
fluency in SGML (or XML). For a simple  example, see my
<a href="nobr.html#valid">notes on validating documents with
<code>nobr</code> markup</a>.
For more information, see the document
<cite><a href="own-dtd.html">Creating your
own DTD for HTML validation</a></cite>.</p>

<h2 id="icon">Say <em>no</em> to &#8220;Valid HTML&#8221; icons</h2>

<p>The useful purpose of validation is to get error messages
and warnings, not a &ldquo;clean report&rsquo;, still less
to show such a report to others. Unless, of course, those
others really pay you for it, or have the power to demand
such a report.</p>

<h3>The icons add nothing to validity</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s useful to write valid markup, in most cases.
But it&#8217;s hardly useful to make a noise about it.
By stating or claiming that a document is valid, you
do not make it any more valid.</p>

<p>Analogously, it&#8217;s useful to 
use proper punctuation when you write in English.
This makes texts somewhat easier to read and understand,
and it adds to the literary quality a bit.
There are slightly different styles of punctuation, and you
should choose one and stick to it.
But it&#8217;s hardly useful to make a noise thereof.

<h3>The icons are cryptic</h3>
<p>The majority of web users don&#8217;t create web pages. Even if they
do, they often do not know much about HTML (or CSS), since they
use wysiwyg tools or publishing systems that do not involve
&#8220;manual&#8221; HTML coding.</p>
<p>Thus, they might even fail to understand the abbreviation
&#8220;HTML,&#8221; still
less the various version numbers,
or they might have just a faint idea of HTML.
More importantly, the word
&#8220;valid&#8221; is misunderstood by most people.</p>
<p>Thus, the icon may look like an enigma to a user.
Would you like to include an icon like
&#8220;Checked SGUFDFY&nbsp;42.5!&#8221; onto your pages and expect users to
decipher that SGUFDFY&nbsp;42.5 means some particular convention
on punctuation?</p>

<p>No wonder the
<cite><a href="http://validator.w3.org/docs/help.html">Help and FAQ for the Markup Validator</a></cite> page
contains, as the first entry, an 
answer to the question
&#8220;Help me! I clicked on an icon and ended up on this strange site!&#8221;
Actually, the question is more informative than the answer.</p>

<h3>The icons are bad propaganda</h3>

<p>People who put &#8220;Valid HTML&#8221; icons on their pages
presumably have a sincere desire to promote validity and the goals
behind that. But they forget that for the great majority of users,
all those validity stamps are just something between line noise
and obscurity. And even if the Web surfer who sees the icon is herself or
himself an author, or intends to become one, why would she or he be
the least inclined into considering validation just because of the
presence of some validity stamps?</p>

<p>Using the icons for propaganda is a bad move.
The icons just aren&#8217;t understood at all by most visitors,
and they are misunderstood by the rest.
Validation isn&#8217;t
really among the most important things that authors should learn.
Most Web pages are invalid, but they have much more serious problems too.</p>
<p>Concentrating on validity means concentrating on <em>formal</em>
aspects. If authors will try to do so too early, they will get
misdirected, and confused. The validators&#8217; error messages
can be very confusing, and novice authors might find themselves
trying to make poorly designed page valid, instead of rewriting it.</p>

<h3>Other &#8220;correctness&#8221; icons: say no to them, too</h3>
<p>It makes more sense 
to do propaganda for automated checking of <strong>CSS</strong>
style sheet syntax,
&#8220;CSS validation&#8221;, which is much more
relevant due to the differences of HTML and CSS and their processing
in browsers. However, &#8220;Valid CSS!&#8221; icons are a poor method
for that, even if we ignore the term confusion. (CSS is not SGML or XML based,
so &#8220;valid&#8221; is a misleading form here.)
The abbreviation &#8220;CSS&#8221; is more cryptic than
&#8220;HTML,&#8221; because it has several interpretations,
and people actually misunderstand it. A casual visitor may well
take &#8220;CSS&#8221; as standing for
Content Scrambling System
or
Cross-Site Scripting
and not Cascading Style sheets.</p>

<p>As regards to declaring compliance to 
<strong>WAI</strong> guidelines,
it&#8217;s yet another thing, and quite different. Such compliance
cannot be checked automatically. More­over, practically all pages
that claim conformance to WAI guidelines make a false claim thereby.
There&#8217;s
more on this in my <cite><a href="../www/acctools.html">Notes on
some tools for checking and improving Web page accessibility</a></cite>.</p>

<h3>The icons lie to prospective clients</h3>
<p>It has been said that prospective clients will look
at the validity and other icons. That is, you, as a person who
creates Web pages for a living, would miss opportunities since
potential customers ignore you if they don&#8217;t see the icons.
I think this grossly overestimates the emphasis that
clients put on validity. Some clients  may care about the icons,
but far more will see them as any normal visitor does, as 
distracting enigmas.</p>

<p class="important">So the prospective
 client who gets impressed by the icons on
your pages actually gets impressed because he was
seriously misled.</p>

<h3>Educated people know that validity claims are often false</h3>
<p>Moreover, people who know enough about validation are also
learning that many validity claims are just false. Either the author
did not actually check validity, or he thought that almost passing
validation is enough, or&#8212;perhaps most often&#8212;the page
validated but was edited later and isn&#8217;t valid any more.
Such things decrease the value of the icons, and pages carrying them,
even if the page itself happens to validate.</p>

<h3 id="favelet">Making the author&#8217;s life easier</h3>
<p>People often argue that the icon is useful to the author
or maintainer of the page. After making some changes, he
can conveniently click on the icon and get a validation
report. Note that this means that the icon will be there,
proclaiming validity, even though the author does not <em>know</em>
yet whether the page is actually valid.</p>
<p>This argument is understandable, but it&#8217;s still all wrong.
It is wrong the pollute one&#8217;s web page with something that
distracts from the content and may confuse the user, just for some
assumed convenience to the author.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is <em>easier</em> to use other tools, since
they can be installed so that they work for any page, without
any inserted code on the pages.
For example, if you use Interner Explorer, you can easily install
&#8220;favelets,&#8221; which are used via the Favorites menu of the
browser. You can find them on Tantek Çelik&#8217;s
<cite><a href="http://tantek.com/favelets/">Favelets</a></cite> page, or you can just cut
click on the following pseudo-link with the right-hand button of the mouse
and select &#8220;Add to Favorites&#8221;:<br>
<code><a href="javascript:void(document.location='http://validator.w3.org/check?uri='+escape(document.location))">javascript:void(document.location=<wbr>'http://validator.w3.org/<wbr>check?<wbr>uri='<wbr>+escape(document.location))</a></code>
</p>

<h3>The W3C is just wrong here</h3>
<p>The reputation, or assumed reputation, of the validity icons is
actually based on the common assumption that the icons are
<strong>seals of approval</strong> by the W3C. Of course, the W3C
would be the first to say that they aren&#8217;t. But the W3C is
factually contributing to the common mis­con­cep­tion, since the W3C
promotes the use of the icons, asks (or actually requires) authors
to make them links to W3C pages, and includes its logo into the
icons.</p>
<p>The W3C has promoted the use of the icons so long that
we cannot expect a change of policy. People at the W3C work with web-related
specifications and technologies, so it is understandable that they
overestimate their meaning as well as users&#8217; ability and willingness
to understand validity (or &#8220;validity&#8221;) issues. But <em>you</em>
should know better.</p>

<h3>There is no excuse now</h3>

<p>If you do not know what the icons really and imply,
you should not even think about using them. And if you do know that,
as you probably know now, having read this far,
you have no excuse for having the icons on your pages.
Using them,
you would be sending a message that will
be either misunderstood or not understood at all by the
vast majority of people. And you would know this.</p>

<p>Sorry, now that you have been explicitly told this, you have lost
your innocence. You cannot plead ignorance any more. If you keep using
the icons, you now know that you are <em>in­ten­tion­al­ly abusing
other people&#8217;s misconceptions</em> for the purpose of your personal
gain, or for your company&#8217;s profits,
or for the purpose of making some propaganda&#8212;maybe for a noble
cause, but the propaganda will be ineffective or it will
work against the purpose.</p>

<h3>The &#8220;check mark&#8221; is a failure mark to some people</h3>
<p><img alt="" title=
"A check mark, used to indicate failure, and a correctness (OK) mark as used in Finland"
src="ok.png" style="margin-right:0.2em; float: left"
width="100" height="70">
The icons contain a check mark, a v-like symbol.
It is widely understood as indicating that something has been checked
and approved (or, in other contexts like in checkboxes,
that something has been selected). But it is 
<em>not culturally neutral</em>.
The
<a href="http://www.cenorm.be">CEN</a> Workshop Agreement 
<cite><a href=
"http://www.cen.eu/cen/Sectors/Sectors/ISSS/CWAdownload/Pages/Eur%20Cult%20Spec%20IT%20Req.aspx"
lang="en" hreflang="en">European Culturally Specific ICT Requirements</a></cite>
explicitly mentions:
&#8220;Special symbols are often used to mark both correct­ness
 and an error (and a check mark in one culture
can have the opposite meaning in another culture).&#8221;
In Finland, the &#8220;check mark&#8221; traditionally indicates 
<strong>disapproval</strong>, e.g. in exam papers as a mark that
an answer has been checked and found wrong. (The cor­rect­ness mark
resembles a percent sign, and could be identified with the
Unicode character <span class="charname">commercial minus sign</span>.)
According to the
<a href=
"http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.0.0/"
>Unicode Standard&nbsp;4.0</a>
(<a href=
"http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.0.0/ch06.pdf#page=15"
type="application/pdf"
>p.&nbsp;160</a>),
the situation is the same in &#8220;a&nbsp;number of other
European countries&#8221;.
People are getting used to the meaning
of a check mark
as an approval symbol, due to the effect of information technology,
but this means unstability and confusion rather than completed
cultural assimilation.</p>

<h3 id="referer">The icon link may fail miserably</h3>
<p>The &#8220;Valid HTML&#8221; icon is <em>required</em>
to be a link to the W3C validator (see
<cite><a href=
"http://validator.w3.org/docs/help.html#icon-license">
License and Guidelines for usage of the "valid" icons</a></cite> on
the
<cite><a href="http://validator.w3.org/docs/help.html">Help and FAQ for the Markup Validator</a></cite> page).
When a document passes validation, the validator says:</p>
<blockquote class="par1">
<p>To show your readers that you have taken the care to create an interoperable Web page, you may display this icon on any page that validates.
Here is the HTML you could use to add this icon to your Web page:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(The statement about &#8220;interoperable Web page&#8221; is
very, very wrong. Validity does not guarantee interoperability, of course.)</p>

<p>This is followed by versions of the icon
 and the HTML markup (in small print in
grey text, setting a very bad example) inserting the icon.
The markup makes the icon a link, though a style sheet on the W3C
pages prevents it from looking like a link, by removing the common
default blue border (against the sound principle that
<a href="../www/links.html">Links Want To Be Links</a>).
The link has the URL<br>
<code><a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer">http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer</a></code><br>
which means that when the link is followed, the browser is expected to
send the address of the page in the
<code>Referer</code> header, among the
<a href="../http.html">HTTP headers</a>.</p>
<p>And this may simply fail. A browser might be configured not to send
the <code>Referer</code> header, or to send a fake header, for privacy reasons.
This is not common, but when it happens, the results are confusing.
The W3C validator sends back an error message page that is tech­ni­cal­ly
correct but understandable to a small fraction of people only.</p>

<blockquote>
    <div id="result">
          <h2 id="results" class="invalid">Sorry! This document can not be checked.</h2>


        <h2><strong>No Referer header found!</strong></h2>
        <p>
          You have requested we check the referring page, but your browser did
          not send the HTTP "Referer" header field. This can be for several
          reasons, but most commonly it is because your browser does not
          know about this header, has been configured not to send one, or is
          behind a proxy or firewall that strips it out of the request before
          it reaches us.
        </p>
        <p>This is <em>not</em> an error in the referring page!</p>
        <p class="last">
          Please use the form interface on the
          <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">Validator Home Page</a> to check the

<p>Web users do not usually prevent their browser from
sending the <code>Referer</code> header.
If they do, they can probably understand the error message and
take some corrective action.
How­ever, some experienced user may have configured the browser of a relative
or a friend &#8220;to protect privacy&#8221;
without explaining the implications, or a user might be used a public
computer where such &#8220;paranoic&#8221; settings are in effect.
Most web pages do not need the <code>Referer</code> header,
so people don&#8217;t usually see problems&#8212;but when they click on
  a &#8220;Valid HTML&#8221; icon, confusion is created.</p>

<p>Moreover, the error message is misleading, since <em>common</em>
reasons to the problem include the following
(see the document <cite><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/178066"
>Internet Explorer Does Not Send Referer Header in Unsecured Situations</a></cite> by Microsoft):</p>
<ul>
<li> Working with a page <em>local</em> to the computer, e.g.
a locally saved web page.</li>
<li> Using a page that has been sent using the HTTPS protocol.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Validity icons are unprofessional</h2>
<p>Jens Meiert has written
the document <cite><a href=
"http://meiert.com/en/blog/20070309/valid-css-and-similar-claims-are-unprofessional/"
>&#8220;Valid CSS&#8221; and Similar Claims Are Unprofessional</a></cite>.
His argument is that validity is a self-evident requirement.
This is basically correct, even though most web sites contains syntax errors
(validity errors). It is pointless to claim that your page lacks syntax
errors, just as it would be pointless for a surgeon to explicitly claim
that his hands are clean.</p>

<h2 id="final">Some final notes: why do I nitpick about
&#8220;validation&#8221;?</h2>
<p>The word &#8220;validation&#8221; and its relatives are used
for a large set of different meanings, even in the Web context.
There&#8217;s (officially!) a &#8220;CSS validator&#8221;,
and there&#8217;s a commercial HTML checker that keeps calling itself
 &#8220;CSE validator&#8221; (despite being a checker that performs
mixed operations, partly on a rather subjective basis),
and &#8220;form validation&#8221; is commonly
used about checking form data by some criteria, etc.
So am I defending a lost cause when I say that
&#8220;validation&#8221; and
&#8220;validator&#8221; should be used as relating to
SGML or XML validation only?</p>

<p>Maybe it is a lost cause. But we all lose then. Either we fall
into confusion, or we use some <em>other</em> verbal expressions
that serve the purpose of saying what we mean. That would mostly mean
the alternative &#8220;SGML or XML validation&#8221;. This would
be inferior to just using the word &#8220;validation&#8221;,
so that e.g. &#8220;checking&#8221; would convey the general and
vague idea. In particular, you would then choose carefully whether you
say
&#8220;SGML validation&#8221; or
&#8220;XML validation&#8221; or perhaps
&#8220;SGML or XML validation&#8221;, with an explanation of the
difference between the two, which is not difficult except if you
want to tell the truth.</p> 

<p><small>Besides, in the XML context, it is essential to distinguish
between two kinds of formal correctness, &#8220;well-formed&#8221; 
and &#8220;valid&#8221;. This makes it increasingly important to
understand and to remember that in the markup context,
the word &#8220;valid&#8221; and its relatives are technical terms,
not to be confused with correctness in general.</small></p>

<h2 id="html5">But what about HTML5?</h2>
<p>HTML5 is now a Candidate Recommendation from the W3C.
<a href=
"http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML5 RC</a> differs from
the WHATWG 
&#8220;<a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/">
HTML
Living Standard</a>. The latter is often called HTML5, too, and
originally the two documents were close to each other, but
they are diverging, and there is no public document on the differences now.</p>
<p>HTML5 is neither SGML-based nor XML-based, though allows a syntactic form
that conforms to XML rules and is sometimes called XHTML5.
HTML5 has its own syntax rules described in prose,
which is rather technical and even formal, but not DTD-based.
It is also rather impractical to try to defined a DTD for it,
as my 
<a href="../html5-dtd.html">
attempt at an HTML5 DTD</a> shows:
too many limitations, too tricky, and the DTD would need to be so permissive that many syntax errors would go uncaught.</p>
<p>So no validation for HTML5. Yet, both
<a href="http://validar.nu">validator.nu</a>
and
<a href="http://validator.w3.org">validator.w3.org</a>
perform &#8220;HTML5 validation&#8221; (in addition
to validating HTML). The point is that these programs, which
are closely interconnected but differ in a manner that has not been
publicly documented, are really polymorphic: when 
a document is submitted to them as HTML5, they
switch to a completely different mode of operation.
This means checking the syntax by HTML5 rules, quite independently
of any DTD.</p>
<p>There is no published document of the specific 
<nobr>variant(s)</nobr> of HTML5 that they check against.
But it seems that they try use the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/">
HTML 5.1 Nightly</a> as the basis but are not really
synchronized with it.</p>
<p>This means that a document may get
the congratulations
&ldquo;This document was successfully checked as HTML5!&rdquo;
today 
and the message
&ldquo;Errors found while checking this document as HTML5!&rdquo;
tomorrow, just because someone changed the rules.</p>

This page is intentionally not valid HTML. Not so much as a protest
to false or misleading claims on validity but as a simple measure
against DOCTYPE sniffing.
The simplest way to promote more standards-compliant processing
of a document by browsers is to use an HTML 4.01 Strict DOCTYPE,
no matter what markup is actually used in the document.
It is ethical to fool browsers that way, since they have been intentionally
designed to do the wrong thing with a DOCTYPE (and unintentionally 
made to do the wrong thing in differing wrong ways).
